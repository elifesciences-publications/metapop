#' Performs computations for connectivity and incidence control.
#' 
#' The output dataframe "abundance" is used in downstream analyses.

library(data.table) # Tested with version 1.12.2 for R version 3.6.0

#' Load data including:
#' 
#' ward_incidence -- the number of patients tested positive
#'   for each variant during the study period. Rows are wards (n = 574), columns are variants.
#'   
#' ward_prevalence -- the proportion of patients tested positive 
#'   at least once for each variant during the study period. Rows are wards (n = 574), columns are variants.
#'   
#' ward_metadata -- for each ward, the ward size in column "n_beds" and ward type in column "PatStat" 
#'   as a proxy to patient fragility, where 2 denotes ICUs and blood cancer units,
#'   1 denotes progressive care units and 0 denotes other wards. (n = 448 wards)
#'   
#' ward_atb_use -- for each ward, the consumption of each antibiotic group in defined daily doses. Column "ddd_total"
#'   is the consumption of all antibiotics (ATC class J01).
#'   (n = 342 wards. HCL wards not in this dataframe did not prescribe antibiotics)
#'   
#' sample_type -- the probability that each sample type (location) is positive for a variant,
#'   aggregated over all wards. Rows are sample types, columns are variants.
#'   
#' sample_locations -- distribution of sample types/locations in wards. For each ward and sample location,
#'   column "n_patients" is the number of patients in which "n_samples" samples were taken.
#'   
#' transfers -- the no. of patients transferred from the upstream ward in column "ward_from"
#'   to the downstream ward in column "ward_to".
